    <h1>HALLOWEEN (2018)</h1>
    <h1>Directed by David Gordon Green
        <h1>Rated R</h1>
    </h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3>Michael Myers is back.</h3>
    <p>From the dead some may say.
        40 years has gone by since the first attack on Laurie Strode on Halloween night in 1963.
        It all started when Michael was just six years old when he first killed his teenage sister.
        Since then, every Halloween night had became a massacre for him and innocient trick or treaters.
        This story begins when Michael is faced locked up in a mental institution and Laurie is miles
        and miles away, scared everday for her life with locks upon locks on her door to not let a single
        person in.
    <p>This movie is great for fellow horror/mystery movie lovers and for those who
        are carrying on with the Halloween movie series. There are 11 Halloween,
        Michael Myers movies including (SPOILER ALERT) Two new movies that are rumored to be
        coming out in 2021 and 2022. So make that lucky number 13.

    <h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek1ePFp-nBI">Halloween (2018) Trailer</a></h1>


    <p>Above I included a link to the trailer if you have not yet already seen the movie
        or if you want to watch it again. The jump scares get me everytime.
        Halloween (2018) is the perfect combination of spooky and scary. The
        Halloween series
        is one every horror movie fanatic should watch. The original movie from 1978, Directed by
        John Carpenter is a true classic and the rest follow.
    </p>
    <p>This newest movie gives a clear sighting of what could happen next, if
        anything does happen next. I give this movie 5/5 stars for the story line,
        creativity of jump scares, and real feel of horror and erie. The ending is a pick
        for your imagination of which way the story ends. After so many years of Michael being shot at,
        hit and pushed down, you would think he would be a goner by now, including the fact he was 61 years old
        in 2018.

        "I always knew he'd come back. In this town, Michael Myers is a myth. He's the Boogeyman. A ghost story to
        scare
        kids.
        But this Boogeyman is real. An evil like his never stops, it just grows older. Darker. More determined.
        Forty
        years ago,
        he came to my home to kill. He killed my friends, and now he's back to finish what he started, with me. The
        one
        person
        who's ready to stop him." -Laurie Strode, IMDB 2018
